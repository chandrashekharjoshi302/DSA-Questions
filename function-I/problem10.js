//write a function to perform multiplication and use return statemnet

function mult(a,b){
    return a*b;

  let result=mult(10,20);
  console.log(result);
  
  
  
  //1-> Return is going to give back the answer to the calling statement.
  
  //2-> As soon as compiler encounters a return statemnet, it will take the answer and go out of the function
