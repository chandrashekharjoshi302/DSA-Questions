//Chuunu has to add 7 and 2, he takes help from munnu

//Muunu return the answer (3PM)

function munnu(a,b){
    return a+b;
  }
  
  let result=munnu(10,20); // now my answer is in calling statemnet
  
  console.log(result);
  
  //1-> Return is going to give back the answer to the calling statement.
  
  //2-> As soon as compiler encounters a return statemnet, it will take the answer and go out of the function
